Users
-----
- /home contains directories for each user
- /root is the root users home directory
- finger
    - gives you more information about a user
- id
    - gives you the uid/gid/groups for a user
        austin ~/projects/astra-infrastructure/terraform/cicd > id root
        uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
    - uids are unique
- /etc/passwd - where the users are stored
    - system users
    - username:password_field:uid:gid:full_name:home_dir:default_shell
    - password is a legacy field - always x
    - austin:x:1000:1000:Austin Burnett,,,:/home/austin:/bin/bash
- /etc/shadow - encrypted passwords
    - similar structure to passwd
    - username:encrypted_pass:days_since_changed:next_change_date:days_warning_field(prior to expiration):disabled_days_field(after expiration, disable):
- pwck - does some checking around /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow
- /etc/group  - group information
- root
    - prevent accidental damage
    - su -
        - default is root
        - su - user
            - logs in as user
            - can affect $PATH
    - # indicates that you are the root user
    - sudo is like su, but on a command basis
- w
    - shows you uptime and who is logged in
- who
    - who -b: last boot time
    - who -m: hostaname and associated user
    - who -r: current run level for user
    - who -q: number of users logged in
    - who -a: shows all information
- last user
    - last command that user performed and whether they're logged in
    - shows the ip address they logged in from


System Users
------------
- some users are utilized by services on the machine as opposed to being an account you'd log in to
- these users tend to have lower UIDs (< 1000)


User IDs
--------
- the linux filesystem doesn't respect the username, it relies on UIDs
- multiple users can have the same UID - but they will have all the same file permissions, etc
- id <username> will give you uid, gid, groups
    austin ~/projects/linux-academy > id
    uid=1000(austin) gid=1000(austin) groups=1000(austin)

    austin ~/projects/linux-academy > id root
    uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

- groups <username> - what groups is this user a member of
- last - who logged in last, from where, are they still logged in?


User Management
---------------
- useradd johndoe
    - default config: /etc/default/useradd OR useradd -D
        - SHELL=/bin/sh (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS)
        - GROUP
        - HOME
        - INACTIVE
        - EXPIRE
        - SKEL
        - CREATE_MAIL_SPOOL

        austin ~/projects/linux-academy > useradd  -D
        GROUP=100
        HOME=/home
        INACTIVE=-1
        EXPIRE=
        SHELL=/bin/sh
        SKEL=/etc/skel
        CREATE_MAIL_SPOOL=no
    - /etc/default/login.defs
        - contains default values for /etc/shadow (password settings)
        - contains UID_MIN/MAX and SYS_UID_MIN/MAX
    - /etc/skel
        - a "skeleton" for a new home directory for a user

        austin /etc/skel > ls -a
        .  ..  .bash_logout  .bashrc  examples.desktop  .profile
    - useradd -c "Austin Burnett" -m -p "linuxacademy" -s "/bin/bash" aburnett
    tail -n 1 /etc/passwd
    aburnett:x:1004:1004:Austin Burnett:/home/aburnett:/bin/bash
- passwd
    - passwd -S user
        - LK says that the password is locked - can't login as this user, they haven't set it yet
        - PS means password is valid and set
        - includes the date the password changed last
    - passwd -l - lock the user's password (lock them out)
    - passwd -u - unlock the user's passwd
- usermod - update version of useradd basically
    - ex. we have a user janniston
      usermod -l jburnett -c "Jennifer Burnett" janniston
- userdel <user>
    - doesn't delete their /home directory by default: userdel -r <username>
