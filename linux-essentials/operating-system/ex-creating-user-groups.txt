***Note:  This excercise will walk the user through creating a new group called accounting.  Then we will add our user to that accounting group.
Step 1:  Log in to your Linux Essentials lab server and become root.
Step 2:  Create a new group called accounting


[root@austburn1 ~]# groupadd accounting


Step 3:  Add the user account called richard from a previous excercise to the group accounting.


[root@austburn1 ~]# usermod -G accounting richard
[root@austburn1 ~]# groups richard
richard : richard accounting


Step 4:  Verify that the user richard was added to the group accounting.
