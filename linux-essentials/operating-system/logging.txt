Logging
-------
- Background/daemon processes typicall log information for debug information
- /var/log
    - messages - pretty general purpose
    - secure - where the damn sudo logs are stored "I will report you!"
- log rotation
    - du le.tar.bz2 -h | awk '{print $1}' # check file size, cut doesn't allow delims with multiple spaces
- most programs rely on the syslog daemon
    - started during the boot process
    - klogd sometimes intercepts kernel logs
    - config can be in: /etc/sys*, /etc/rsyslog.conf
- dmesg can be used to examine the kernel ring buffer
    - stored in memory
    - kernel messages
    - dynamic in nature
    - pipe to less to parse
