Step 1:  Log in to your Linux Essentials lab server and become the root user.


Step 2:  We are going to create a new user.  The users's full name is Mary Phillips.  The username should be called mphillips.  The default shell should be the bourne again shell.  After creating the user then set the password; The password should be LinuxPassword

su -
useradd -c "Mary Phillips" -s "/bin/bash" mphillips
passwd mphillips


Step 3:  There is a specific file on the linux file system in which we can look at to verify that our new username was created how would we view this?


[root@austburn1 ~]# tail -n 1 /etc/passwd
mphillips:x:1002:1002:Mary Phillips:/home/mphillips:/bin/bash


Step 4:  Create a user account called richard with all defaults without specifying any specs.


useradd richard


Step 5:  Give the new user account richard a password LinuxPassword and a full name of Richard Layton


passwd richard
[root@austburn1 ~]# usermod -c "Richard Layton" richard
[root@austburn1 ~]# tail -n 1 /etc/passwd
richard:x:1003:1003:Richard Layton:/home/richard:/bin/bash
