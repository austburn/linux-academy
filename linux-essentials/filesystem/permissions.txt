File Permissions
----------------
- File permissions as provided by ls -l
    - drwxrwxr-x. 2 user user  100 Mar   2 19:14 folder
      -rwxrwxr-x. 2 user user 4096 Mar   2 19:14 file
        d = directory
        - = file
        r = read
        w = write
        x = execute
    - three sets of permissions: user, group, other (everyone else)
    - rwx
      421 = 7
    - for directories, x means that we can cd into it, while for files it means it can be executed
    - 777 means that a file has full permissions
    - -rw-r--r--
       420400400 = 644
    - chmod 644 file - adds read/write to user, read to group/others
      chmod u+x file - adds execute permissions to the user
      chmod o-w file - remove write permissions from others
      chmod a+x file - all get execute permissions
      chmod ugo+rwx file - give all permissions to user/group/others
    - you must own the file or be the root account to change the permissions
    - chown changes the ownership
        chown username.groupname filename
