Networking Basics
-----------------
- TCP/IP Protocol
    - Really just an agreement on how to converse
- OSI Reference Model (1983)
    - Modular network communication structure standard
    - 7 layers: application, presentation, session, transport, network, datalink, physical
        - go down the stack, accross the wire, back up the stack
        - Physical: electrical signals between two hosts
        - Datalink:
            - Rules and procedures for accessing the physical layer
            - defines how hosts are identified on the network and how those mediums are accessed
            - defines how to verify data received from physical layer
        - Network:
            - Enables the routing of data
            - Determine the next destination of a packet
            - IP/ICMP protocols apply here
        - Transport:
            - Divides data into transmittable chunks - packets
            - Also reassebmles these packets
            - Ensures packets arrive in tact
            - TCP/UDP protocols apply here
        - Session:
            - Establish and maintain a session between hosts
        - Presentation:
            - Ensures the information is formatted correctly
        - Application:
            - Responsible for providing access to the underlying protocols
    - From A --> B
        - A breaks data down to fragments
        - fragments transferred via packets
        - B resequences and defragments data
- TCP/IP
    - connection-based transport protocol
    - ensures data exchanged reliably between two hosts
    - Web servers, email servers, FTP servers, etc. utilize this
    - Requires network/processing overhead - affects latency
- UDP
    - connectionless transport protocol
    - Packets are sent unacknowledged --> Less reliability
    - Streaming audio, VoIP, etc. utilize this
- ICMP
    - verify network communication between hosts
    - ping
- Ports
    - provided by TCP and UDP at the transport layer
    - logical connection between TCP/UDP and upper layer protocols
    - Popular ports:
        - FTP: 20, 21
        - Telnet: 23
        - SMTP: 25
        - HTTP: 80
        - POP3: 110
        - NetBIOS: 137, 138, 139
        - HTTPS: 443
    - Registered ports: 1024 - 49151
    - Dynamic (private) ports: 49152 - 65535
- IP Address is a Layer 3 network address; required by every host on an IP-based network
- MAC Address is hard coded on the network board; Layer 2 address
- IPV4 is a 32 bit scheme
    - 192.168.1.1: 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001
- IPV6 is a 128 bit scheme - four character hexadecimal numbers separated by colons
    - FE80:0000:0000:0000:0202:B3FF:FE1E:8329
- Network Address Translation: NAT
    - Exposes a single public IP
    - Maps to several private IPs on the backend via LAN
    - basically a router
- Private IP ranges
    - Class A: 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
    - Class B: 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
    - Class C: 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
    - Non-addressable IP addresses
- Subnet mask
    - IP addresses are divided into two pieces
        - Network: all nodes can share
        - Node: must be unique to each node
    - Each non-zero octet classifies the network portion of the IP
    - Class A
        - first octet must be between 1 and 126
            - network address
        - last 3 octets are the node address
        - default subnet mask: 255.0.0.0
        - 126 possible network addresses
        - 16.7 million possible node addresses (per network)
    - Class B
        - first octet is between 128 and 192
        - first 2 octets are the network address
        - default subnet mask: 255.255.0.0
        - 16834 possible networks
        - 65534 possible node addresses
    - Class C
        - first octet must be between 192 and 223
        - first 3 octets are network address
        - last octet is node address
        - default subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
        - 2 million possible networks
        - 254 possible node addresses
    - shorthand aka CIDR
        - 192.168.1.1/24 - indicates that 24 bits used for the subnet mask (Class C)
        - a slash 24 (/24) can have 254 nodes
    - you do not have to use the default subnet masks: 255.255.252.0 for example
