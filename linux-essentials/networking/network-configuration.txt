Network Configuration
---------------------
- ping:                 test connectivity
- dig:                  lookup ip addresses for DNS names
- netstat:              list network connections, routing info, NIC info
- route:                current route/net settings
    - shows you where your default requests are routed through
    - can add routes to the routing table
- traceroute:           traces the route a packet takes
- ifconfig:             current network settings
- ip addr:              current ip address and settings
- /etc/resolve.conf:    this is where our DNS info is stored

Creating a Static IP
--------------------
- Use "static" as opposed to the DHCP protocol
    - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol: Used on Internet Protocol networks for dynamically distributing network configuration parameters (IP addresses, etc.)
- Set you IP address     - Can use the CIDR notation
- Set your subnet mask   - ^
- Set the network address segment
- For example:
DEVICE="eth0"
BOOTPROTO="static"
IPADDR="10.10.30.210"
NETMASK="255.255.255.0"
NETWORK="10.10.30.0"

Routing Table
-------------
- route shows our routing table
    - Destination - ipaddress or dns name (always use ip address)
    - Gateway     - gateway through which our host/network can be accessed (router)
    - Genmask     - Netmask of our destination network
    - Iface/Type  - destination network interface; can be blank (all); type: unicast, broadcast, multicast, etc. (outside scope)
- route add -net <network_address> netmask <subnet_mask> gw <router_address>
    - route add -net 10.10.40.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 10.10.30.1
- route del -net "" "" "" "" ""
- route add default gw 10.10.30.1 (default gateway/router for our machine)

Troubleshooting
---------------
- netstat
    -a listening and non-listening sockets
    -i stats of network interfaces (received/transferred/dropped)
    -l listening sockets
    -s summary of each protocol
    -r routing table
- traceroute
    - traces the path of a packet through routers using the icmp protocol from ping
